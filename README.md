üìä Netflix Analyst Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI
üìÅ Project Overview
Welcome to the Netflix Analyst Dashboard project! This interactive Power BI dashboard provides detailed insights into the content available on Netflix across different countries, time periods, and genres. The primary goal of this project is to clean, transform, and visualize Netflix's raw data to uncover valuable business insights that can inform content strategy, regional preferences, and user engagement.

With a well-rounded set of metrics and visuals, this dashboard empowers Netflix and similar streaming platforms to analyze and optimize their content offerings for global audiences.

üßº Data Cleaning & Preparation (Performed in Python)
The project leverages Python (specifically Pandas) for thorough data cleaning and preparation. The following steps were performed:

*Removed Unnecessary Columns: Columns such as cast, description, and director were removed as they were irrelevant for the analysis.*

*Handled Null Values: Missing data in the country column was filled with the most common country: United States. Additionally, missing values in the date_added, rating, and duration columns were forward-filled.*

*Removed Duplicates: Duplicate values across all columns were detected and addressed to ensure data integrity.*

*Standardized Date Format: The date_added column was standardized using pd.to_datetime() with the format set to mixed for consistency.*

*Cleaned String Data: Extra white spaces in string data were removed to ensure clean text values.*

*Converted Release Year: The release_year was converted into the appropriate year format for accurate year-based analysis.*
